# JavaScript Math random() Method

## We can generate random numbers with javascript using the Math.random() Method

## Syntax: Math.random()

# Parameters of javascript Math random() method
The Math random javascript method in javascript does not need any arguments

# Return Value of JavaScirpt Math random() Method
When we call this method it will give a pseuso-random number between 0 and 1

# Note: in the output 0 is inclusive and 1 is exclusive. This means the output can have 0 but it will not have 1

# Exceptions 
Math random method does not have any exceptions

Ex: var myRandom = Math.random();
console.log("Your random number is",myRandom); output => Your random number is: 0.2777

## How does the Math random() Method work?

Numbers that our computer generate are called pseudo-random numbers.These numbers can repeat, mean they do so consistently
Pseudo-random numbes are enough for our practical applications. 

# The Pseudo-random number generators(PRNGs)
The PRNG is an algorithm and one PRNG can be better than the other. 
PRNG does not depend javascript it is depends on the browser.
