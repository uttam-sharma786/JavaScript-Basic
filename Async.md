## How to use Async/ Await in IIFE and Arrow functions
# An Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE) is a technique to excute a function immediately as soon as us define it.

# IIFEs will be remove the running process once they are executed.
# We can also use arrow function to creating an async function

## Note: the await keyword can only used inside an async function. We can use an IIFE to invoke the async function only once.

## Why use the async/await Syntax?

# The async/await systax : To handle promises without using .then() and .catch() method chaining.
## Note: We remove nested callbacks function
